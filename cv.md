## Briefly About Myself:

I am creative in my work, fully involved in process, responsible and stress - resistant. I take on new projects with interest, I try to bring the matter to the end. I am effective to do work by my own but also feel comfortable working in team, I easily solve conflicts but prefer to avoid and compromise. At school I was engaged in programming in QBasic, the topic of programming has been interesting to me since childhood. At the moment I am studying at Frontend developer at RSSchool.
